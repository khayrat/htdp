;; Exercise 18.1.13
;; Develop the function to-blue-eyed-ancestor. The function consumes a family tree 
;; (ftn) (see section 14.1) and produces a list that explains how to get to a 
;; blue-eyed ancestor. If there is no blue-eyed ancestor, the function produces 
;; false.

;; A path is a list of 'father and 'mother, which we call a direction.
;; Here are the two data definitions:

;; A direction is either
;;  the symbol 'father or
;;  the symbol 'mother .
;; A path is either
;;  empty or
;; (cons s los) where s is a direction and los is a path.

;; The empty path indicates that a-ftn has 'blue in the eyes field. If the first 
;; item is 'mother, we may search in the mother's family tree for a blue-eyed 
;; ancestor using the rest of the path. Similarly, we search in the father's 
;; family tree if the first item is 'father and use the rest of the path for 
;; further directions.

;; Examples:
;; (to-blue-eyed-ancestor Gustav) produces (list 'mother) for the family tree 
;;in figure 35;
;; (to-blue-eyed-ancestor Adam) produces false in the same setting; and
;; if we added (define Hal (make-child Gustav Eva 'Gustav 1988 'hazel)) then 
;; (to-blue-eyed-ancestor Hal) would yield (list 'father 'mother).

;; Build test cases from these examples. Formulate them as boolean expressions, 
;; using the strategy of section 17.8.

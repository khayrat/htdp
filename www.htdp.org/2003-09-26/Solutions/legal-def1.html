A definition has (in order):
  - an open parenthesis, 
  - the word define,
  - another open parenthesis,
  - at least two variables (maybe more),
  - a close parenthesis
  - an expression, and finally
  - a close parenthesis.

legal definitions:
  
1: This definition matches the requirements above, 
   where the variables are f and x, and the expression
   is just the variable x.
2: This definition also matches the requirements above,
   where the variables are f and x, and the epxression
   is also just a variable; this time y.
3: This definition matches the requirements above,
   where the variables are f, x and y and the expression
   is merely a number: 3.
   
illegal definitions:

1: This sentence is not a definition becuase the symbol
   'x is in a place where only variables can go.
2: This sentence is not a definition because the position
   where an expression goes does not contain an expression,
   since (x) is not an expression
3: This sentence is not a definition because there is
   only one variables after the second parenthesis.

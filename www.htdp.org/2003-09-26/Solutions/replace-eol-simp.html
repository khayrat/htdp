;Data Definition:
a list-of-numbers is either
  1. empty or
  2. (cons n lon)
  where n is a number and lon is a list-of-numbers

;Contract, Purpose, Header:

(define (replace-eol-with alon1 alon2) ...)


;Template:
(define (replace-eol-with alon1 alon2) 
  (cond
    [(and (empty? alon1) (empty? alon2)) 
     ...]
    [(and (empty? alon1) (cons? alon2)) 
     ...(first alon2)...(rest alon2)...]
    [(and (cons? alon1) (empty? alon2))      
     ...(first alon1)...(rest alon1)...]
    [(and (cons? alon1) (cons? alon2)) 
     ...(first alon1)...(rest alon1)...
     ...(first alon2)...(rest alon2)...]))

;;replace-eol-with : 
;;  list-of-numbers list-of-numbers  -&gt;  list-of-numbers
;;to construct a new list by replacing 
;;empty in alon1 with alon2
;Definition following the strategy of section 17.3:
(define (replace-eol-with alon1 alon2) 
  (cond
    [(and (empty? alon1) (empty? alon2)) 
     empty]
    [(and (empty? alon1) (cons? alon2)) 
     alon2]
    [(and (cons? alon1) (empty? alon2))      
     alon1]
    [(and (cons? alon1) (cons? alon2)) 
     (cons (first alon1) 
           (replace-eol-with (rest alon1) alon2))]))
|#

;Definition from above - simplified:
(define (replace-eol-with alon1 alon2) 
  (cond
    [(empty? alon1) 
     alon2]
    [(empty? alon2)      
     alon1]
    [else 
     (cons (first alon1) 
           (replace-eol-with (rest alon1) alon2))]))

;Tests:
(check-expect 
 (replace-eol-with empty empty)
 empty)

(check-expect 
 (replace-eol-with empty (list 1 2 3))
 (list 1 2 3))

(check-expect 
 (replace-eol-with (list 1 2 3) empty)
 (list 1 2 3))

(check-expect 
 (replace-eol-with (list 1 2 3) (list 7 8 9))
 (list 1 2 3 7 8 9))

;; check-guess : number number -&gt; symbol
;; to determine whether guess is larger, smaller, or equal to target

;; the answer should be 'Perfect
;; if the guess is 1 and the target is 2,
;; the answer should be 'TooSmall
;; if the guess is 1 and the target is 0, 
;; the answer should be 'TooLarge

(define (check-guess guess target)
  (cond
    ((= guess target) 'Perfect)
    ((&lt; guess target) 'TooSmall)
    ((&gt; guess target) 'TooLarge)))

;; EXAMPLES TURNED INTO TESTS:
(check-guess 1 1) "should be" 'Perfect
(check-guess 1 2) "should be" 'TooSmall

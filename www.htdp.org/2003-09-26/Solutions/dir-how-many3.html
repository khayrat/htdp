(define-struct file (name size content))

;; A file is a structure:
;;   (make-file n s x) 
;; where n is a symbol, s is a number, and x is some Scheme value.

;; A list-of-files is either
;;   empty, or
;;   (cons s lof) where s is a file and lof is a list of files.

(define-struct dir (name dirs files))

;; A dir is a structure:
;;   (make-dir n ds fs) 
;; where n is a symbol, ds is a list of directories, and fs is a list of files.

;; A list-of-directories is either
;;   empty or
;;   (cons s lod) where s is a dir and lod is a list of directories.


;; files: 
(define hang (make-file 'hang 8 empty))
(define draw (make-file 'draw 2 empty))
(define read (make-file 'read! 19 empty))
(define one  (make-file 'part1 99 empty))
(define two  (make-file 'part2 52 empty))
(define thre (make-file 'part3 17 empty))
(define rdme (make-file 'read 10 empty))

;; directories: 
(define Code (make-dir 'Code '() (list hang draw)))
(define Docs (make-dir 'Docs '() (list read)))
(define Libs (make-dir 'Libs (list Code Docs) '()))
(define Text (make-dir 'Text '() (list one two thre)))

The question also asks:

Why are we confident that the function produces correct results?

By following the design recipe, we know that each function eventually
lives up to the promise of its purpose statement. Hence when we call
'how-many-in-dir-list' from 'how-many', we are confident that the
function will deliver the number of files in a list of directories --
no matter how complicated the computation gets. Similarly, when we
call 'how-many' from 'how-many-in-dir-list', we know that it computes
how many files are in a single directory -- no matter what it needs to
do to compute this number. Even if something goes wrong, the test
cases quickly expose which function(s) messed up.

In order for any list-of-2-symbols to belong to list-of-symbols, the
data definition for list-of-symbols tells us it must be either empty
or constructed with cons, where the first part is a symbol and the
rest part is a list of symbols. Since the first of a list-of-2-symbols
is a symbol, we only have to make sure that the rest of a
list-of-2-symbols is a list-of-symbols. Well, the rest of a
list-of-2-symbols is constructed with cons, its first part is a symbol
and its rest part is empty. Since empty is a list-of-symbols, the rest
of a list-of-2-symbols is a list-of-symbols. Since the rest of a
list-of-2-symbols is a list-of-symbols, the entire list-of-2-symbols
is a list-of-symbols.

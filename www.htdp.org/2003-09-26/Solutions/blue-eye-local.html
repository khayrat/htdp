#| 18.1.10 adapting blue-eyed-descendant?
------------------------------------------------------------
;data definition
A parent is a structure:
     (make-parent loc n d e)
where loc is a list of children, n and e are symbols, and
d is a number.
|#
(define-struct parent (children name date eyes))
#|
A list-of-children is either
   1. empty or
   2. (cons p loc) 
   where p is a parent and loc is a list of children.

;; blue-eyed-descendant? : parent  -&gt;  boolean
;; to determine whether a-parent any of the descendants 
;; (children,  grandchildren, and so on) have 'blue in 
;; the eyes field
|#
(define (blue-eyed-descendant? a-parent)
  (local 
    [(define (blue-eyed-descendant? a-parent)
       (or 
        (symbol=? (parent-eyes a-parent) 'blue)
        (blue-eyed-children? (parent-children a-parent))))
     (define (blue-eyed-children? aloc)
       (cond
         [(empty? aloc) false]
         [else (or (blue-eyed-descendant? (first aloc))
                   (blue-eyed-children? (rest aloc)))]))]
    (blue-eyed-descendant? a-parent)))

;;example family tree - used in examples below
;; Youngest Generation:
(define Gustav (make-parent empty 'Gustav 1988 'brown))

(define Fred&amp;Eva (list Gustav))

;; Middle Generation:
(define Adam (make-parent empty 'Adam 1950 'yellow))
(define Dave (make-parent empty 'Dave 1955 'black))
(define Eva (make-parent Fred&amp;Eva 'Eva 1965 'blue))
(define Fred (make-parent Fred&amp;Eva 'Fred 1966 'pink))

(define Carl&amp;Bettina (list Adam Dave Eva))

;; Oldest Generation:
(define Carl (make-parent Carl&amp;Bettina 'Carl 1926 'green))
(define Bettina 
  (make-parent Carl&amp;Bettina 'Bettina 1926 'green))

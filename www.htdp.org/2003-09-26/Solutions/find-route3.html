   Find Route in Graph: Global Tests

   find-route : node node graph -&gt; (listof node) or #f
   Purpose: produce a list of nodes, starting with origination 
    and ending destination. The list represent a path from 
    the origination node to the destination node in a-graph.
    If there is no path, the function produces #f. 
|#

(define (find-route origination destination graph)
  (cond
    ((eq? origination destination) (list destination))
    (else (local ((define possible-route 
		    (find-route/list (neighbors origination graph) destination graph)))
	    (cond
	      ((boolean? possible-route) #f)
	      (else (cons origination possible-route)))))))

#| find-route/list : (listof node) node graph -&gt; (listof node) or #f
   Purpose: produce a list of nodes, starting with one node on lo-originations 
    and ending destination. The list represent a path from 
    the node on lo-originations to destination in a-graph.
    If there is no path, the function produces #f.     |#
(define (find-route/list lo-Os D graph)
  (cond
    ((empty? lo-Os) #f)
    (else (local ((define possible-route (find-route (first lo-Os) D graph)))
	    (cond
	      ((boolean? possible-route) (find-route/list (rest lo-Os) D graph))
	      (else possible-route))))))

#| neighbors: node graph -&gt; (listof node)
   (define (neighbors a-node a-graph) ...)
   Purpose: compute a-node's neighbors in a-graph
|#
(define (neighbors a-node a-graph)
  (cond
    ((empty? a-graph) (error 'neighbors "can't happen"))
    (else (cond
	    ((eq? (first (first a-graph)) a-node)
	     (second (first a-graph)))
	    (else (neighbors a-node (rest a-graph)))))))

;; equivalently, with Scheme's built-in lookup function:
(define (neighbors a-node a-graph)
  (second (assq a-node a-graph)))

   Tests: data followed by expessions

   test-on-all-nodes : graph -&gt; ???
   Purpose: to produce all possible results of connecting nodes in a graph
    The actual format of the answer is irrelevant, as long as it is a datum
    that contains the result of all possible applications.

   Questions:
    - Why does the output of test-on-all-nodes contain the output of all
      possible find-route-problems in Graph?

    - Specify the class of data that test-on-all-nodes produces, given some graph.
|#

(define Graph 
  '((A (B E))
    (B (E F))
    (C (D))
    (D ())
    (E (C F))
    (F (D G))
    (G ())))


(define (test-on-all-nodes a-graph)
  (local ((define all-nodes (map first a-graph)))
    (map (lambda (a-node)
	   (map (lambda (another-node)
		  (list a-node another-node
		        (find-route a-node another-node a-graph)))
	        all-nodes))
          all-nodes)))
  
(pretty-print (test-on-all-nodes Graph))
